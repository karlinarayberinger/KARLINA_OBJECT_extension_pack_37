<p>Lately (especially this year) I have been becoming more accustomed to the intuitive or speculative hypothesis I have that all reality really is just imagined by exactly one source of intelligence (and how everything I know to be real objects in my life are actually figments of a dream (and that dream in particular is literally all that karbytes actually is (and what karbytes actually is takes the literal form of a simulated universe))).</p>
<p>That might seem self-centered and naive of me to suggest, but I noticed an eerie accumulation of coincidences and other thematic elements of my recent experiences which make it seem like I am literally the rendering of a simulated <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universe</a> which takes place from the perspective of exactly one apparently humanoid vantage.</p>
<p>The reason why I say that such an idea is self-centered and naive (in an unsettling and potentially <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_37/main/chatgpt_karbytes_30april2025_p0.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unethical</a> way) is that such an &#8220;ideology&#8221; contextualizes all phenomena I am aware of existing as being conjured up exclusively for my own benefit and solely within my own solipsistic frame of reference.</p>
<p>Such a perspective seems neutral to the idea of free will (but I feel strongly inclined due to extensive logical analysis and empirical testing to take the uncompromising perspective of a hard determinist (even though I find it somewhat empowering and &#8220;politically correct&#8221; to endorse a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_ontology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compatibilistic</a> perspective (or, more accurately, ideology) due to the fact that a compatibilistic worldview purports that free will exists as variable degrees of conscious control which an information processing <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agent</a> experiences and wields as a tool for manipulating how that agent&#8217;s experience unfolds in accordance to that agent&#8217;s goals and desires)).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">The reason why I tend to say that I am a hard determinist instead of a compatibilist is that I think there are forces beyond my own humanoid nervous system which act on that nervous system (even if that nervous system and encompassing physical environment is ultimately entirely a highly-detailed simulation).</span></p>
